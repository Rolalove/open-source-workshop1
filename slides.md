# Beyond Fixing Docs
<div></div>

### What is Open Source ?
The term [open source](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software) refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
<br>
<br>
In other word we can say;<br>
Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution.

It worthy to know the core principle:  **The open source way**
- Collaboration
- Transparency
- Release early and often
- Inclusive meritocracy
- Community

# The Evolution of Build Tools: From Webpack to Vite
<div></div>

Problem: Slow development sever startup and update time.
<br>
<br>
A major pain point for developers has been the slow performance of traditional bundlers, particularly Webpack. These tools can take a significant amount of time to process all your code and libraries, leading to frustrating delays while working.

### The Webpack Era: Powerful but Slow
- Webpack has been a popular and powerful bundler for years.
- It offers extensive configuration options and supports complex build processes.
- However, as projects grow larger, Webpack's performance often deteriorates.
- Developers face long initial build times and slow hot module replacement (HMR).
- These delays interrupt the development flow and reduce productivity.

### The rise of vite: Blazing fast development

- Vite is a revolutionary front-end build tool known for its exceptional speed.
- It leverages native ES modules in the browser, eliminating the need for bundling during development.
- Its innovative features like hot module replacement (HMR) enables near-instantaneous updates, streamlining development workflows.
- Builders can experiment and iterates at lightning speeds, leading to fast development cycles and increased productivity.

### Key Advantages of Vite over Webpack

- Instant server start: Vite doesn't bundle your entire application on startup.
- Lightning-fast HMR: Updates are reflected almost immediately in the browser.
- Out-of-the-box TypeScript support: No need for additional loaders or plugins.
- Optimized builds: Vite uses Rollup for production builds, resulting in smaller bundle sizes.
- Simpler configuration: Less boilerplate and easier setup compared to Webpack.

By addressing the pain points of Webpack and other traditional bundlers, Vite has quickly become a preferred choice for many developers looking to optimize their development experience and boost productivity.

# Vite's Powerful Plugin Ecosystem
<div></div>
One of Vite's strengths is its robust and flexible plugin system, which allows developers to extend and customize their build process efficiently.

### Key Features of Vite's Plugin Ecosystem
-  Simplicity: Vite plugins are typically more straightforward to write and use compared to Webpack loaders and plugins.
- Rollup Compatibility: Many Rollup plugins work out-of-the-box with Vite, expanding the available ecosystem.
- Performance: Plugins in Vite are designed to maintain the tool's speed advantage.
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Integration: Plugins can easily tap into Vite's HMR system for instant updates.
### Popular Vite Plugins
- @vitejs/plugin-react: Provides React Fast Refresh support.
- @vitejs/plugin-vue: Enables Vue 3 single-file component support.
- @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: Adds Svelte support to Vite.

- vite-plugin-pwa: Generates service worker for Progressive Web Apps.
- vite-plugin-windicss: Integrates the WindiCSS framework with Vite.

### Creating Custom Plugins
Vite's plugin API allows developers to create custom plugins tailored to their specific needs. This can include:

- Custom file transformations
- Handling of non-standard file types
- Integration of development servers or tools
- Modification of the build process

### Plugin Ecosystem vs Webpack
While Webpack has a vast ecosystem of loaders and plugins, Vite's plugin system offers several advantages:

- Simpler API: Vite plugins are often easier to develop and maintain.
- Faster execution: Aligned with Vite's performance-first approach.
- Better developer experience: Plugins integrate seamlessly with Vite's instant server start and HMR capabilities.

# Beyond Vite: A broader impact
<div></div>
 The growing plugin ecosystem, combined with Vite's speed and simplicity, makes it an attractive option for developers looking to optimize their build tooling and workflow.

Vite takes a different approach by leveraging two key technologies.
- esbuild: This is the powerhouse behind vite's speed. This ultra-fast bundler pre-compiles dependecies into optimized bundles, significantly reducing the amount of work needed on every change. 
<br>
<br>

- Hot Module Replacement: vite utilizes a more effiecient HMR implementation that update only the changed modules instead of reloading the entire page. This keeps your development environment snappy and responsive. 

***Faster than a speeding bundler***: curious to know what makes vite tick like a clockwork caffeine machine? The source code is wide open! Peek inside and witness the revolutionary tech (esbuild and HMR) that keeps your development lightening fast.

# A deep dive into Chakra UI
<div></div>

**The problem : Building UIs in any framework**
<br>

### Getting Started
Chakra UI is a popular component library for React applications. Here's how to get started:

Install Chakra UI and its peer dependencies:

```
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

Wrap your application with the ChakraProvider:

```
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```
<style scoped>
h1,h3 {
  color: #90EE90; 
  
}
</style>
---
transition: slide-up
---

# Start using Chakra UI components:
<div></div>

```
import { Box, Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Button colorScheme="blue">Click me</Button>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

### Extensibility
Chakra UI is highly extensible:

- Custom themes: Customize colors, fonts, and more.
- Component styling: Use the sx prop or style props for quick modifications.
- Custom components: Easily create new components based on Chakra primitives.
<style scoped>

  color: #90EE90; 
  
}
</style>

### Beyond React
While Chakra UI is primarily for React, there are community-driven ports for other frameworks:

- Vue: Chakra UI Vue
- Svelte: Svelte Chakra UI
- Next.js(App)
- Next.js(Pages)
- Gatsby


These ports aim to bring Chakra's design system and component library to other popular frameworks.

### Chakra UI with Panda CSS and UnoCSS
Chakra UI can be used alongside other CSS solutions:

- Panda CSS: A CSS-in-JS solution that complements Chakra UI well. Use Panda for custom styles and animations while leveraging Chakra's component library.

<style >
h3 {
  color: #90EE90; 
  
}
</style>
---
transition: slide-up
---

- UnoCSS: An atomic CSS engine. While there's some overlap with Chakra's utility props, UnoCSS can be used for additional utility classes not covered by Chakra.
<br><br>
### Example combining Chakra UI and UnoCSS:
```
import { Box } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Box className="uno-custom-class" borderWidth="1px" p={4}>
      Chakra UI box with UnoCSS class
    </Box>
  )
}
```
Remember to configure your build process to work with both Chakra UI and your chosen CSS solution.
Existing component libraries can be:
- complex and difficult to learn
- inflexible for customization

### Chakra UI
A  UI component focused on:
- Ease of use
- Flexibility
- Modern design 
<br>
<br>
### Chakra UI solutions
- simple and accessible components
- responsive design
- Easy customization with a well- documented API

# Open Source: Powering Collaboration and Innovation
<div></div>
Open source software (OSS) offers a wealth of benefits for both users and developers. Here are some key advantages:
<br>

-	Cost-Effective: Often free to use and modify, saving on licensing fees and promoting affordability.
<br>

-	Enhanced Security: With open code, a larger community can identify and fix vulnerabilities, leading to more secure software.
<br>

-	Flexibility & Customization: The ability to modify the source code allows users to tailor software to their specific needs.
<br>

-	Strong Community Support: Open source projects often have active communities providing help, tutorials, and ongoing development.
<br>

-	Faster Innovation: Collaboration from a global pool of developers can accelerate bug fixes and the addition of new features.
<br>

-	Future-Proof: Not locked into a single vendor, open source offers greater control and avoids potential software obsolescence.
